# OCR & Table Recognition Project

## Overview
This project is designed to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and recognize tables in images or scanned documents. It combines image processing and machine learning techniques to extract text and tables from images, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of digital data extraction.

## Features
- **OCR Processing**: Converts image-based text into digital, editable formats.
- **Table Detection & Recognition**: Accurately identifies and processes tables in images.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Enhances image quality for better OCR and table recognition.
- **Supports Multiple Image Formats**: Compatible with a variety of image file types.

## Components
The project comprises several key components:
1. **Image Preprocessing**: Modules for noise reduction, binarization, and normalization.
2. **Table Detector**: Utilizes morphological transformations and contour detection for table extraction.
3. **Hough Line Detection**: Employs Hough Line transformations for line identification in tables.
4. **OCR Engine**: Integrates OCR capabilities for text digitization.
5. **Data Postprocessing**: Structures recognized text and table data.
